<h1>Rhyming without having to go online</h1>

<p>Tired of having to go out to some slow, ad-ridden
Javascript monstrosity just to get a few rhymes when your
mind is blocked?  rhydict is your answer!</p>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h2>About rhydict</h2>

<p>rhydict is a command-line rhyming dictionary, suitable
for poets and whomever else wants to try to rhyme words.  It
utilizes the excellent <a
	href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">CMU
	Pronouncing Dictionary</a> from Carnegie Mellon
University, which is generously made available for public
use with almost no restrictions.</p>

<p>rhydict strives for simplicity in execution while
maintaing as much power as one can expect from such a simple
application.  As such, it provides sensible defaults
(returning only perfect rhymes on the last syllable, with
results separated by single spaces) while allowing options
for imperfect rhymes; for rhyming multiple syllables; for
limiting results only to words of a given number of
syllables; and for arbitrary characters to separate
results.</p>

<p>rhydict should satisfy the needs of most poets (that is
the reason it was written).  If you have any suggestions for
improvement, please let me know; you can find contact
information with the program's <a
 href="https://www.github.com/dgoodmaniii/rhydict">source</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Using rhydict is simple.  In your favorite terminal
emulator, just run the program, creatively named <span
	class="scode">rhydict</span>.  Give rhydict the word you
want to rhyme with the <span class="scode">-w</span> option:
</p>

<pre class="code">
$&gt; rhydict -w"orange"
</pre>

<p>Strictly speaking, the quotation marks here are
unnecessary, but it's good practice to make it clear what
part of your command line is the rhyming word.  You'll see
output like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
$&gt; rhydict -w"orange"
alonge bunge challenge counterchallenge expunge grunge lozenge lunge orange plunge runge scavenge sponge younge 
</pre>

<p>Notice that each word is separated from the others by a
single space.  If you want to use a different character, let
rhydict know by using the <span class="scode">-s</span>
option:</p>

<pre class="code">
$&gt; rhydict -s"|" -w"orange"
alonge|bunge|challenge|counterchallenge|expunge|grunge|lozenge|lunge|orange|plunge|runge|scavenge|sponge|younge|
</pre>

<p>This, obviously, gives you the same list, but separated
by a pipe character rather than spaces.  Note that this is
only a single character; if you give rhydict a
multi-character string, only the first character will be
used.  If you want to use a newline, say <span
	  class="scode">-s"newline"</span>.</p>

<p>Now, maybe you'd like to find a word that rhymes on more
than just the last syllable; maybe you'd like to rhyme
<em>two</em> syllables.  You can do so by using the <span
	class="scode">-n</span> option.  You can match any number
of syllables you'd like, provided that the word you gave it
has at least that number of syllables:</p>

<pre class="code">
$&gt; rhydict -n3 -w"syllable"
billable syllable
</pre>

<p>Matching with less than three syllales will produce more
rhymes:</p>

<pre class="code">
$&gt; rhydict -n2 -w"syllable"
abominable acceptable acceptable(2)...
</pre>

<p>A great number, in fact, since "syllable" ends in two
very common terminal sounds.</p>

<p>You may wish only to find matches which are a certain
number of syllables long; you can tell rhydict this using
the <span class="scode">-l</span> option:</p>

<pre class="code">
$&gt; rhydict -n2 -w"syllable"
abominable acceptable acceptable(2)...
</pre>

<p>Finally, rhydict allows you to find <em>imperfect</em>
rhymes as well as perfect ones.  These are rhymes in which
only the vowel sounds are the same, not the consonants.  Use
the <span class="scode">-i</span> option for this:</p>

<pre class="code">
$&gt; rhydict -i -n2 -w"billing"
</pre>

<p>However, be aware the imperfect rhymes will likely give
you <em>lots</em> of results; it's unlikely to be
particularly useful to you.</p>

<p>That's all there is to rhydict; happy rhyming!</p>
