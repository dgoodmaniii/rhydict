rhydict

A simple rhyming dictionary which operates from the command
line.  Uses the CMUDict pronunciation dictionary from
Carnegie-Mellon University, which is essentially public
domain, with no restrictions on its use.

Contains options for number of syllables to rhyme; length of
the rhymed words by number of syllables; whether imperfect
rhymes are also desired; and what character you'd like to
separate results.  See the man page for details.
